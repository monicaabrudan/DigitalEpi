# The importance of Digital Epidemiology


*Digital Epidemiology* is an emerging field, which can be broadly described as the use of digital data for the purpose of answering epidemiological questions.

The importance of *Digital Epidemiology* has been raised to a global level during the pandemic. The value of bringing together genomic with epidemiological and clinical data improved public health decision making, informing experts with regard to virus variants expansions and adding significant contributions to the investigation on the origin of the virus. 

Moreover, the pandemic has taught us that the effective use of *Digital Epidemiology* can impact on operational decisions in healthcare settings, impacting on patient wellbeing and outcomes.

During the COVID pandemic there has been a learning curve for many laboratories, who were able to use genomic and digital data to good effect, changing operational approaches and decisions based on results. However, interdisciplinary teams formed of wet-lab scientists, bioinformaticians, clinicians and non-technical staff (hospital managers, for example) often found barriers in communication of information. The relevance and impact of *Digital Epidemiology* was often difficult to explain between different professional specialisations. Scientists familiar with *Digital Epidemiology* often found it challenging to communicate to colleagues what genomic data **could** and **could not** reveal.
